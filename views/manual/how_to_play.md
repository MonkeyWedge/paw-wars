## How To Play
__{{config.site.name}}__ is a turn based game, as as such, the administrator is able to set a "turn limit".  This limit is how many turns you can play before the game is over and your score is calculated.  Your current limit is __{{game.turns}}__.  Keep in mind that if this setting is set to 0, you'll be in "endless" mode.

Once your choose your starting location, you can visit the [Market](/manual/market) to buy and sell items, the [Airport](/manual/airport) to travel around to different locations, or the [Bank](/manual/bank) to manage your money.

The game ends after all the turns allowed have been used, you're poor and destitute, or you die.
